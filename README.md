============

A little project involving OpenCV stereovision and PCL.
The final result is supposed to be a system which retrieves a point cloud
using stereovision (OpenCV) and presents it using Point Cloud Library. 
All that neatly wrapped in QT GUI.

The technical purposes of this project is to:
* make a cool application for 3D imaging
* learn some PCL
* learn how to generate depth maps with opencv
* learn to mix opencv and PCL and QT
* learn how to make QT work with CMake

Might contain small amounts of CUDA.
